# Type Checker

A type checker built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This has not been created with responsive design or accessibility in mind, and was created as a JavaScript exercise. The site allows users to edit the text, font size, font weight and leading/line height, as well as change the font style to italic. Users are also able to select from a series of pre-defined colour palettes to preview these changes.

Exercise was done as part of a course from SuperHi, and fonts were taken from Google Fonts.
